The Controller Service is required to control the kart using an Xbox controller. To use the Controller Service, the TinCan Service must also be installed.

# Installation

- Ensure that both `install.sh` and `controller.sh` are executable (or make them executable using `chmod +x *.sh` in this directory);
- Run `install.sh` from this directory.
